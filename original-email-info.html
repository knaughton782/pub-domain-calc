<!-- INFO FROM INSTRUCTOR: So I have been studying Python in my spare time and I have developed a calculator that will tell a student when a song will enter the public domain. This is an area that everyone seems to struggle with. I was wondering if there was a way to implement this program into my class as a tool the students could use. -->

<!-- Here is the instructor's code notes: -->


<!-- get today's date -->
from datetime import date
today = date.today().year



<!-- calculate 77 years after the song was released and display: This part of the calculator will determine when a song written after 1977 will enter the public domain -->
def calc77():
pubDomainYear = (authorDeath + 70)
print(songTitle,'will enter the public domain in', pubDomainYear)
<!-- end calculate 77 years after the song was released -->



<!-- calculate 95 years after the song was released and display: This part of the calculator will determine when a song written before 1977 will enter the public domain -->
def calcBC():
pubDomainYear = (songYear + 95)
print(songTitle, 'will enter the public domain in', pubDomainYear)
<!-- end calculate 95 years after the song was released -->



<!-- determine if the song is already in public domain and display: This part of the calculator will tell you when a song has already been placed into the public domain  -->
def antique():
pubDomainYear = (songYear + 95)
print(songTitle, 'entered the public domain in', pubDomainYear)
<!-- end determine if the song is already in public domain  -->



<!-- This part of the calculator will handle the equation if the song was written after 1977 and the artist is still alive  -->
def still_alive():
pubDomainYear = (songYear + 95)
print(songTitle, 'won"t enter the public domain until at least', pubDomainYear)
<!-- end artist is alive calculation  -->


<!-- same as onclick checkSong function  -->
while True:
songTitle = input("What song would you like to learn about? ")
songYear = int(input('What year was the song released? '))

if songYear >= 1977:
death = input('Is the writer still alive? (y/n) ')
if death == 'y':
still_alive()
else:
authorDeath = int(input('What year did the writer die? '))
calc77()

if songYear < 1977: if songYear>=(today-94):
    calcBC()

    
if songYear < (today - 95): antique() if input("Would you like to learn about another song? (y/n) ") == 'n':
        break
